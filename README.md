# React-vs-Angular
This project aims to develop a Trello-like task management web application using React and Angular. The primary goal is to compare the performance of these two frameworks, focusing on DOM handling, drag-and-drop functionality, and memory management. This project is part of a research study to evaluate which framework performs better in frequent DOM updates and UI responsiveness.
Project Structure

React Implementation: A Trello clone built using the React framework.
Angular Implementation: The same Trello clone built using the Angular framework.
Features: 1) Create, edit, and delete Boards. 2) Add, modify, and remove Lists within Boards 3) Manage Cards (tasks) with drag-and-drop functionality across Lists. 4) Real-time updates and smooth interactions.
