React vs Angular: Trello Clone Performance Comparison

The aim of this project is to compare the performance of two popular frontend technologies, React and Angular, by building a Trello-like task management application in each. This comparison focuses on DOM handling efficiency, memory management, and user experience in a realistic single-page app.

Project Structure
The repository contains two folders:
trello-clone-react: The Trello clone built in React.
trello-clone-angular: The Trello clone built in Angular

Functionalities
Both applications include:

Board Management: Create, rename, and delete boards.
List Management: Add, edit, and delete lists within boards.
Card Management: Add, edit, delete, and reorder cards within lists.
Drag-and-Drop: Move cards between lists smoothly.
Local Data Persistence: Stores data locally to simulate real application usage.
These features allow for a thorough comparison of React and Angular in handling frequent updates and dynamic interactions.
